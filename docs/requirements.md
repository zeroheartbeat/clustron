# Clustron: Requirements Specification

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Project Name:** Clustron  
**Technology Stack:** .NET 6+, C#, gRPC/TCP, Dependency Injection  
**License:** MIT (recommended)  
**Status:** Draft / Under Development

---

## üìç Purpose

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for **Clustron**, a distributed clustering and messaging framework built for .NET applications.

Clustron provides essential infrastructure for server-side systems to:
- Discover and join a cluster
- Elect a leader
- Communicate with other nodes reliably
- Handle failures and recover gracefully

This document serves as a guide for developers, contributors, and stakeholders involved in the design, development, and use of Clustron.

## üéØ Functional Requirements

### 1. Cluster Formation (`Clustron.ClusterFormation`)
- Nodes must be able to discover each other via:
  - Static configuration (list of IPs/hosts)
  - Dynamic discovery plugins (mDNS, Consul, etc.)
- Nodes verify:
  - Compatible version
  - Matching cluster ID
- Cluster state is propagated to all members on change.

### 2. Coordinator Election (`Clustron.Election`)
- Election algorithm: Bully algorithm (default)
- Coordinator responsibilities:
  - Maintain sequence/order of total messages (optional)
  - Handle cluster-wide decisions
- Automatic failover when leader fails (with re-election)
- Support for custom election strategies (Raft, Paxos) via interfaces

### 3. Node Communication (`Clustron.Comms`)
- Supports:
  - Synchronous messages (request/response)
  - Asynchronous messages (fire-and-forget)
- Message routing options:
  - Direct (unicast)
  - Broadcast
- Transport options:
  - TCP (default)
  - gRPC (plugin-based)
- Pluggable message serializers (e.g., JSON, Protobuf)

### 4. Message Ordering and Reliability (`Clustron.Messaging`)
- Message delivery supports:
  - FIFO per sender
  - Optional total ordering (coordinator-based)
  - Causal ordering (via vector clocks, optional)
- Reliability features:
  - Retries and exponential backoff
  - Acknowledgements
  - Deduplication (message ID tracking)

### 5. Health Monitoring (`Clustron.Monitoring`)
- Periodic heartbeat mechanism
- Configurable timeouts for:
  - Missed heartbeats
  - Suspicion threshold
- Node states:
  - Alive
  - Suspect
  - Dead
- Auto-removal of failed nodes

### 6. Membership Management (`Clustron.Membership`)
- Maintain updated view of cluster members
- Notify nodes on member joins and leaves
- Configurable quorum thresholds for decision making

## ‚öôÔ∏è Operational Requirements

### 7. Configuration Management (`Clustron.Config`)
- Supports JSON or YAML-based configuration
- Runtime config reload support (where applicable)
- Bind to .NET DI configuration system

### 8. Observability (`Clustron.Observability`)
- Metrics exposed via:
  - Prometheus
  - OpenTelemetry
- Structured logging with correlation and message IDs
- Tracing support for message flows and node state changes

### 9. Admin CLI or Dashboard (`Clustron.Admin`)
- View:
  - Cluster topology
  - Coordinator
  - Node health status
- Actions:
  - Force leader re-election
  - Disconnect/remove node
  - Drain traffic from a node

---

## üîí Security Requirements

### 10. Secure Communication (`Clustron.Security`)
- Optional TLS for node-to-node communication
- Message signing or checksums (configurable)
- Role-based or token-based access control for Admin API

---

## üß™ Development & Testing

### 11. Test Framework and Simulation (`Clustron.TestKit`)
- Simulate:
  - Network partitions
  - Message delays/loss
  - Node crashes and recoveries
- Include test harness for unit and integration testing

## üìè Non-Functional Requirements

| Area               | Requirement                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**    | Join cluster in < 5s; message latency < 100ms on LAN                        |
| **Scalability**    | Support at least 50 active nodes per cluster                                |
| **Extensibility**  | Pluggable transport, serialization, and consensus layers                    |
| **Compatibility**  | .NET 6+, .NET Standard 2.1; Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)          |
| **Documentation**  | Inline XML docs + website/API docs via DocFX or similar tools               |

---

## üî≠ Future Enhancements

- Raft-based consensus module (plugin)
- Gossip protocol support
- State replication via CRDTs or event sourcing
- Kubernetes-native discovery and clustering
- UI-based visual dashboard for live cluster view

---

## üß± Assumptions & Constraints

- Cluster nodes are expected to have low-latency network connections
- Message delivery is not guaranteed in async mode unless reliability is enabled
- Application integration should occur within .NET apps (ASP.NET Core, workers, etc.)

> üîß **Note:** Requirements and scope may evolve as Clustron matures through community adoption and real-world feedback.
