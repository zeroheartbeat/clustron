# Clustron: Distributed Clustering Framework for .NET

## 📘 What is Clustron?

**Clustron** is an open-source **.NET-based clustering and messaging framework** built to simplify the development of distributed systems. It enables applications to form **peer-to-peer clusters**, perform **leader election**, and exchange **synchronous and asynchronous messages** with reliability and consistency.

Designed to be modular, extensible, and platform-independent, Clustron offers the essential building blocks for high-availability, real-time coordination, and fault-tolerant communication between nodes in a network.

---

## 🎯 Why Clustron?

Building distributed server-side applications is a complex task involving:
- Discovering and connecting nodes
- Electing a leader or coordinator
- Managing network partitions and failovers
- Ensuring reliable message delivery and ordering

**Clustron abstracts these responsibilities** into a lightweight, pluggable library that can be integrated directly into your .NET applications. Developers can focus on their business logic while Clustron manages the complexity of distributed communication and coordination.

## 🛠️ Core Features

- 🕸️ **Peer-to-Peer Cluster Formation**  
  Nodes can dynamically discover and join clusters without centralized coordination.

- 👑 **Leader Election & Failover**  
  Automatic election of a coordinator node with pluggable consensus algorithms.

- 🔄 **Sync & Async Messaging**  
  Reliable message transport with optional ordering, retries, and acknowledgments.

- 🧠 **Health Monitoring**  
  Heartbeats, timeouts, and node health states to detect and respond to failures.

- 🧩 **Modular & Extensible**  
  Pluggable transports (TCP, gRPC), serializers (JSON, Protobuf), and protocols (Raft-ready).

## 🧩 Typical Use Cases

Clustron can serve as a foundation for any .NET-based distributed system that requires coordination, messaging, or clustering. Common examples include:

### ✅ Distributed Product Categories:
- **Microservices Coordination Platforms**  
  Enable coordination across stateless service replicas.

- **Real-Time Game Server Clusters**  
  Manage game session leadership and state sync across regional nodes.

- **Distributed Cache Managers**  
  Ensure consistency in cache invalidation or cache ownership.

- **IoT and Edge Clusters**  
  Coordinate sensor hubs, gateways, and field devices in real time.

- **Workflow Engines and Job Runners**  
  Distribute task orchestration and execution with automatic leader handling.

- **Custom Control Planes (e.g., K8s alternatives)**  
  Build your own orchestrator for VMs, containers, or specialized workloads.

## 🧠 Who Should Use Clustron?

- .NET developers building scalable backend systems
- Teams needing lightweight clustering without heavy dependencies
- Engineers implementing state machines, distributed workflows, or coordination protocols
- Developers working on custom frameworks, orchestrators, or message routers
